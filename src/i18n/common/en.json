  "home.header.info": "Welcome to Waqanki Ecolodge! \nWe are much more than just a lodge. We are a Private Conservation Reserve that was born from the initiative of a family passionate about the preservation of nature. Our story began with the concern for the intensive extraction of orchids in the Alto Mayo, a region rich in biodiversity. \nWe decided to take action and allocate a space dedicated exclusively to the conservation of these beautiful flowers in their natural state. Today, we are proud to have an orchid garden that houses more than 250 species, each one more impressive than the last. \nBut our mission does not stop here. Amidst the constant deforestation caused by agricultural and livestock production in the region, we have set aside an impressive 104 hectares of forest for conservation. Here, we have identified more than 400 bird species, thus contributing to the protection and revitalization of bird diversity in the area. \nAt Waqanki Ecolodge, you will not only find an exceptional place to stay, but you will also immerse yourself in a world of natural beauty and conservation. Join us on this exciting journey towards a sustainable future and discover the magic of biodiversity in the heart of nature. We welcome you to a unique experience at Waqanki Ecolodge!",
